The Doctor recognises his voice instantly. It was his a long, long time ago. The time when he first stole The Tardis. The first Doctor. 

Doctor: What?

First Doctor: ...What?

Doctor: What!

First Doctor: Are you lost?

Doctor: No, I'm not lost. Why are you here?

First Doctor: I just happened to be here. Then you popped up.

The Doctor's hands start glowing again. This time with much more intensity than before. The Doctor leans back as the energy engulfs him.

First Doctor: I think it's best that I just help you...

The First Doctor pushes his older self backwards into The Tardis and follows him inside.

First Doctor: Oh, this seems familiar. On the contrary, I don't see why you need so many consoles. I...

The Tardis doors suddenly snap-shut and starts dematerialising without both of them touching any of the controls. The Cloister bell starts ringing and The Tardis is shaking violently with both doctors stumbling around, trying to grab onto anything they can. The Doctor is still regenerating with his regenerative yellow and orange energy bursting everywhere. The console sparks with smoke pouring out of the controls. The screen shows the Tardis in a deadly spiral in the Time Vortex.




Bang!



The Tardis has landed; sparks are still flying around the console but for the most part, everything seems to have quitened down. The First Doctor goes up to The Doctor who seems to be trying to avoid him, matching his movement.

First Doctor: What shall I call you then? Hmm?

[Silence]

First Doctor: Not the talkative type I see. I think I'll just name you %name%

Doctor: Please don't call me that.

First Doctor: What's wrong with %name%?

Doctor: Better not answer that.

First Doctor: Turn around!

Doctor: I'm not sure you're going to like this. Something's wrong. My regeneration stopped half-way through...

First Doctor: What?

Doctor: You heard me. I have the bosoms and butt of a woman but the face of a man. People are going to think I'm a hooker!

First Doctor: I think we have more important things to worry about.

The Doctor can't stop feeling worried about his new image

The Doctor: Like what?

First Doctor: Such as the fact we're dead in the water, in what looks by these co-ordinates in a black whole and none of your controls seem to be working.

The Doctor: Yeah it seems we are running out of power. We're going to have to move quick to the engine room to sort this out.


...: We've only got around 2 hours to get the things we need to fix this otherwise we're done for. On the plus side, no one will know where we disappeared to.

First Doctor: We don't even know what the problem is yet. We might not even be able to fix it.

The Doctor: Always room for some positivity I see.

First Doctor: Yes, always, %name%...
