      	<pre>Sadly this game doesn't actually have any playable content. I uploaded more because of the concept of a story game rather than a mini game but only had around 8-12 hours to create because of a busy weekend.</pre><br/><pre>Something to improve is to advance further and to spend more time on the content rather than getting carried away trying to juice'. Any tips are most welcome. :)</pre><br/><pre>I'll probably try and continue this game after LD is over</pre>
