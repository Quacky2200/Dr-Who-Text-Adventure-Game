The Doctor is on his knees, bending backwards in anger shouting...

Doctor: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

He shoves his glowing fists into the snow hoping to stop regenerating. He feels unsteady and gasps as his hands freeze in the cold ice-white snow...

Doctor: I will not change!

He raises his hands, inspecting the glow disappearing from his hands; feeling his palms...

...: I will not change. I will not! No, no, no, no, no, no. The whole thing's rediculous.

Doctor: Hello? Is someone there?

...: Who's that?

Doctor: I'm the Doctor.

...: The Doctor. No, I don't think so! No, dear me no. You may be a doctor, but I am The Doctor. The original, you might say...
